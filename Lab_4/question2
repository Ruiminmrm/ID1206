Unique!

Yes!

What happens to when you attempt to edit file4.txt after removing file3.txt?

file4.txt becomes read-only, and the contents disappered. The reason is that the file it links to no longer exists,
so the operating system can not find the file to open or edit. This type of link does not store any content, but
the path to the file that actually stores it, thus file3.txt.
